## Running QTO

# Unzip the QTO.zip archive to run QTO for new and old benchmarks

# Old benchmarks

To run a stratified analysis of QTO on the old benchmarks, please refer to the script 'job-FB-stratified.sh'. Note that we re-used the pre-trained ComplEx link predictor of CQD, available in 'model/dataset_name' folder

# New benchmarks

To run the experiments on the new benchmarks, please refer to the script 'job-new-FB15k237.sh'. Also in this case we re-used the same link predictor.
