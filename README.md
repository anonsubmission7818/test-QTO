## Running QTO

# Unzip the QTO.zip that can be found at 'https://github.com/anonsubmission7818/test-QTO/releases/tag/v1.0.0 archive' to run QTO for new and old benchmarks. The archive contains all the files, the scripts, and the pre-trained models we used to run QTO. For additional details on QTO please refer to the original implementation https://github.com/bys0318/QTO/tree/main.

# Old benchmarks

To run a stratified analysis of QTO on the old benchmarks, please refer to the script 'job-FB-stratified.sh'. Note that we re-used the pre-trained ComplEx link predictor of CQD, available in 'model/dataset_name' folder

# New benchmarks

To run the experiments on the new benchmarks, please refer to the script 'job-new-FB15k237.sh'. Also in this case we re-used the same link predictor.
